# Currency_Exchange
This program is a currency converter that allows users to convert between five different currencies: GBP, USD, EUR, INR, and EGP.

The currencies list stores the five supported currencies.
The available_currencies string is a comma-separated list of all the currencies in the currencies list.
The while loop runs continuously until the user exits the program.
Inside the loop, the program first prompts the user to enter the currency they want to convert from.
The program then prompts the user to enter the currency they want to convert to.
The program then prompts the user to enter the amount of currency they want to convert.
The program then checks to make sure that both the currency and converted_currency are valid currencies.
If the currencies are valid, the program then calculates the converted amount based on the current exchange rates.
The program then prints the converted amount to the console.
If the user enters an invalid currency, the program will print an error message and ask the user to try again.
